# USF-Deep-Learning-Project

## Authors: Wei He, Isabella Zhai
### The goal of this porject is to conduct an exploration of some basic deep learning techniques for object detection and classification tasks. Specifically, we would love to apply deep learning to do image classification for animal pictures. The intention of this page this to provide a general overview of this project, the steps we took, as well as the modeling outcome.
